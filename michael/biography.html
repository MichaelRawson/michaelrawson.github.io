I was born in Durham, but after a few weeks my parents <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/alisonrawson/">Alison</a> and <a href="http://www.thiazyl.com/Biography.html">Jeremy</a> moved to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fens">Fens</a> near Cambridge, where I grew up with my brother <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/staff/jamesrawson/">James</a>.

<p>
After school I read computer science (with physics, believe it or not) from 2014-17 at <a href="https://www.robinson.cam.ac.uk/">Robinson College, Cambridge</a>.
I was interested in the logical end of CS by this point, so I wrote a <a href="https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Name_Carrying_Type_Inference.html">computer-checked</a> <a href="papers/ba.pdf">Part II dissertation</a>, supervised by <a href="https://dominicpm.github.io/">Dominic Mulligan</a> and <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~vb358/">Victor Gomes</a>.

<p>
Afterwards I got interested in automated reasoning and moved to Manchester to study for my doctorate with <a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~regerg/">Giles Reger</a> and <a href="http://voronkov.com/">Andrei Voronkov</a>, 2017-2020ish. My thesis was on <a href="papers/phd.pdf">Applications of Machine Learning to Automated Reasoning</a>.
For about a year afterwards I continued as a postdoc with Giles working on his EPSRC project <a href="https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FV000209%2F1">CAPS: Collaborative Architectures for Proof Search</a>.
I met my wife <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/m-rawson">Michaela</a> around this time, when she was also a student.

<p>
I was then very fortunate to end up in <a href="https://lkovacs.com/">Laura Kovács'</a> group as a postdoc in Vienna. I stayed there until 2025, working on all kinds of things with all kinds of people.
Vienna treated me very well, but I could not stay forever and eventually took a permanent position at Southampton, where I am a "New Frontiers Fellow" (write your own Star Trek jokes, they're probably still funny).
We now live in Oxford, near to where Michaela works and not so far on the train from Southampton.
