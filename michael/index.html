 <h2>Bio</h2>
 <p>
I was born in Durham to my parents Alison and Jeremy, but moved shortly after to the fens around Cambridge, where I grew up with my younger brother, James.
Skipping forward several years, I met my wonderfully-tolerant girlfriend Genevieve at sixth form, then did an undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Cambridge.
In the immediate future, I'm about to start a PhD in the field of automated reasoning at Manchester with the <a href="http://vprover.org">Vampire</a> team.
Outside of work, I enjoy physical pursuits, reading, and music.
