  <p>
I am a computer scientist under <a href="http://lkovacs.com/">Laura Kov√°cs</a> in the <a href="http://apre-group.at">APRe</a> group of <a href="https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/">TU Wien Informatics</a>, Austria.
I am generally interested in computer reasoning systems, such as automatic theorem provers.
In the past I have done work applying machine learning techniques to reasoning, and also work on parallelism within <a href="https://vprover.github.io">Vampire</a>, these supervised by <a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~regerg/">Giles Reger</a>.

  <p>
<a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=veUl7JQAAAAJ">Google Scholar</a> is quite good at tracking me, but I also keep a <a href="log.html">log</a> of my academic activities, including copies of publications.
I also keep a very minimal <a href="CV.pdf">CV</a>.
You can contact me via <a href="mailto:michael@rawsons.uk">e-mail</a>.
